Simdezvous is a package that allows Simias Collections (iFolders)
to be shared using the dns-sd protocol (Apple's Rendezvous).
When the package is properly installed a Rendezvous domain is created
in the Simias store.  Collections can then be created against that domain
and then shared in a P2P manner with other Simias users that have the 
Simdezvous package installed.

Simdezvous is a play on Novell's Simias framework and Apple's Rendezvous.

simdezvous components
----------------------------

libsimdezvous - is a native library that bridges the Mono/.NET code to
Apple's dns_sd.so.  This library is Simias/iFolder specific and does not
export all the functionality/Apis of Apple's library.

Simdezvous - is a managed .DLL that runs as a Simias thread service.
It creates and publishes a Simias member to the network and browses
for other Simias members.  It is also repsonsible for creating the
Rendezvous domain in Simias and managing the member list.

The Simdezvous project is still beta code and needs extensive
testing before I submit an actual release.
