----------------
Building Simias
----------------

Linux
------
	You will need to have mono and gtk-sharp installed and working.  You can 
	get those from the Ximian Red Carpet server or http://www.go-mono.com.

	To compile is the traditional:
		./configure
		make
		make install

Win32
------
	You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine.
        - Cygwin
	- .NET framework compiler and libraries

	To compile is the traditional:
		./configure
		make
		make install

OS X
------
	We are working to get Simias working on OS X.  Right now there are some 
	issues too large to cover here.  Once you do get mono going on OS X, the
	Simias project should work much like it does on Linux.

	To compile is the traditional:
		./configure
		make
		make install
