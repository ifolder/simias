The SimpleServer assembly was  added to the iFolder project so
developers and curious users could setup their own dedicated
iFolder server.  For the time being, Simple Server cannot
run side by side with the iFolder client under the same local user
account.  You must dedicate a separate machine or run Simple
Server in a separate user session.

The SimpleServer assembly is an add on thread service to Simias
which enables it to become a simple iFolder server.  The
member list (users) is created from a simple xml file -
SimpleServer.xml which is located in the (simias-target-directory)/etc.
Simple Server synchronizes the SimpleServer.xml members to the Simple Server
roster contained in the Simias store.  Once Simple Server is up and
running you can add/delete members in the xml file.

To install the SimpleServer module add the following line
to your Simias.config file located at $(HOME)/.local/share/simias

The line should be added to the Services section of the Simias.config file
<configuration>
  <section name="ServiceManager">
    <setting name="Services">
      <Service name="Simias Simple Server" assembly="Simias.SimpleServer.dll" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.SimpleServer.Service" />
    </setting>
  </section>
</configuration>

You must also remove three services that will already be present in the configuration
file.  They are: 
      <Service name="Simias Domain Watcher" assembly="Simias" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.DomainWatcher.Service" />
      <Service name="Simias PO Service" assembly="Simias" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.POBox.POService" />
      <Service name="Simias Sync Client" assembly="Simias" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.Sync.SyncClient" />

Also located in this directory are two .config files.  If you are running the server
on a Windows machine copy "web.config" to (simias-target-directory)/web directory.
If you are running Linux, copy "web.config.linux" to to your web directory and rename
the file to "web.config".

You can "tail" the log file to check if Simple Server is synchronizing the xml member
list to the Simias roster.  The log file is located at: $(HOME)/.local/share/simias/Simias.log

When an iFolder client joins the Simple Server domain all logins (username & password) are 
validated against the Member in the XML file.  The iFolder client may join or attach to multiple
Simple Servers.

Enjoy!
