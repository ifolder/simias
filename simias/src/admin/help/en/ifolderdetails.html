<H4>Understanding iFolder Access Rights </H4>
<p>The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of access for members of an iFolder:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Owner<BR>
    </B>Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically the user who created the iFolder. The owner user can use the iFolder client to transfer ownership to another member of the iFolder. The iFolder Admin user can transfer ownership to any user on the iFolder server from the iFolder &gt; General tab.</P>
  <P>The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for member users, and can remove the Full Control right for any member. With an enterprise server, the disk space used by the owner&#146;s iFolders count against the owner&#146;s user disk quotas on the enterprise server.</P>
    <P>If a user is deleted as a user for the iFolder system, the iFolders owned 
      by the user are orphaned. Orphaned iFolders are temporarily assigned to 
      the iFolder Admin user as owner. Membership and synchronization continues 
      for other users while the iFolder Admin user determines whether an orphaned 
      iFolder should be deleted or assigned to a new owner.</P>
  <P><B>Full Control</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. The user with the Full Control right has read/write access to the iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner.</P>
  <P><B>Read/Write</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</P>
  <P><B>Read Only</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can copy an iFolder file to another location and modify it outside the iFolder.</P>
