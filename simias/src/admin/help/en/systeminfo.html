<P>The iFolder Admin user is the primary administrator of the iFolder 
enterprise server. Whenever iFolders are orphaned, ownership is transferred to 
the iFolder Admin user for reassignment to another user or for deletion. You initially 
specify the iFolder Admin user during the iFolder enterprise server configuration 
in YaST. </P>
  <P>The iFolder Admin user must be provisioned to enable the iFolder Admin to 
    perform management tasks. iFolder tracks this user by the LDAP object GUID, 
    allowing it to belong to any LDAP container or group in the tree, even those 
    that are not identified as Search DNs. The user&#146;s movement can be tracked 
    anywhere in the tree because it is known by the GUID, not by the user DN.</P>
  <P>The 
iFolder Admin right can be assigned to other users so that they can also manage 
iFolder services for the selected server. Use the Administrators page in the Novell 
iFolder 3.x plug-in to add or remove the iFolder Admin right for users. Only users 
who are in one of the DNs specified in the LDAP Search DN are eligible to be equivalent 
to the iFolder Admin user.</P><P>If you assign the iFolder Admin right to other 
users, those users are governed by the roster and Search DN relationship. The 
user is removed from the roster and stripped of the iFolder Admin right if you 
delete the user, remove the user&#146;s DN from the list of Search DNs, or move 
the user to a DN that is not in the Search DNs.</P>
  <P>The System page displays the following iFolder Admin details for the iFolder 
    domain. </P>

          <P>              Consider the following demands on your system to determine an appropriate file size limit for iFolders in your environment:</P>
            <ul><li><p>Intended use               
            </p></li>

          is no quota to limit file sizes, the practical limit is governed by 
          the file system on the user's computer. For example, FAT32 volumes have 
          a maximum file size of 4 GB minus 1 byte. </p>
