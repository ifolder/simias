  <h3><a name="manage"></a>Managing Users of An iFolder</h3>
  <p>Within an iFolder, you can perform 
the following tasks:</p>
  <h4>Adding New Shared User</h4>
  <p>Click Add to add new shared members to the selected iFolder.The new page 
    opens that allows you to add users to the list of shared users.</p>
	
  
  <h4>Assigning Rights to a Shared User</h4>
  <p>On the Members page, select the shared members and click the rights you want 
    to assign to them. </p>

<H3><a name="accessright"></a>Understanding iFolder Access Rights </H3>
<p>The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of access for members of an iFolder:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Read Only</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can copy an iFolder file to another location and modify it outside the iFolder.</P>
  <P><B>Read/Write</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</P>
	<P><B>Full Control</B><BR>
      A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. The 
      user with the Full Control right has read/write access to the iFolder and 
      manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner. But, 
      only the owner have the right to delete an iFolder.</P>
  <P><B>Owner<BR>
      </B>Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically the 
      user who created the iFolder and only he or she can delete this iFolder. 
      The owner user can use the iFolder client to transfer ownership to another 
      member of the iFolder. The iFolder Admin user can transfer ownership to 
      any user on the iFolder server.</P>
    <P>The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user has read/write 
      access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for member users, 
      and can remove the Full Control right for any member. </P>
  <P>If a user is deleted as a user for the iFolder system, the iFolders owned by the user are orphaned. Orphaned iFolders are assigned temporarily to the iFolder Admin user as owner. Membership and synchronization continues for other users while the iFolder Admin user determines whether an orphaned iFolder should be deleted or assigned to a new owner.</P>
