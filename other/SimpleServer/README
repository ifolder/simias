The SimpleServer assembly is an add on to the iFolder client
which enables it to become a simple iFolder server.  The
member list (users) is created from a simple xml file -
SimpleServer.xml.  The SimpleServer module synchronizes
the SimpleServer.xml members to the SimpleServer roster
contained in the Simias store.

To install the SimpleServer module add the following line
to your Simias.config file located at $(HOME)/.local/share/simias

The line should be added to the Services section of the Simias.config file
<configuration>
  <section name="ServiceManager">
    <setting name="Services">
      <Service name="Simias Simple Server" assembly="Simias.SimpleServer.dll" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.SimpleServer.Service" />
    </setting>
  </section>
</configuration>


When an iFolder client joins this domain all logins (username & password) are 
validated against the Member in the XML file.
