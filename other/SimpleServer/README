The SimpleServer assembly was  added to the iFolder project so
developers and curious users could setup their own dedicated
iFolder server.  For the time being, Simple Server cannot
run side by side with the iFolder client under the same local user
account.  You must dedicate a separate machine or run Simple
Server in a separate user session.

The SimpleServer assembly is an add on thread service to Simias
which enables it to become a simple iFolder server.  The
member list (users) is created from a simple xml file -
SimpleServer.xml which is located in the (simias-target-directory)/etc.
Simple Server synchronizes the SimpleServer.xml members to the Simple Server
roster contained in the Simias store.  Once Simple Server is up and
running you can add/delete members in the xml file.

To install the SimpleServer module modify the following lines
to your Simias.config file located at $(HOME)/.local/share/simias for Linux or
%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Local Settings\Application Data\simias for Windows.

Modify the ServiceManager section of the Simias.config file. It sould look
like this when done:

<configuration>
  <section name="ServiceManager">
    <setting name="Services">
      <Service name="Simias Change Log Service" assembly="Simias" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.Storage.ChangeLog" />
      <Service name="Simias Simple Server Domain Provider" assembly="Simias.SimpleServer.dll" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.SimpleServer.Authentication" />
      <Service name="Simias Simple Server" assembly="Simias.SimpleServer.dll" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.SimpleServer.Service" />
    </setting>
  </section>
</configuration>

You can "tail" the log file to check if Simple Server is synchronizing the xml member
list to the Simias roster.  The log file is located at: $(HOME)/.local/share/simias/Simias.log
for Linux or %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Local Settings\Application Data\simias\Simias.log for Windows.

When an iFolder client joins the Simple Server domain all logins (username & password) are
validated against the Member in the XML file.  The iFolder client may join or attach to multiple
Simple Servers.

Enjoy!
