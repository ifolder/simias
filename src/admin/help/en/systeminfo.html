enterprise server. Whenever iFolders are orphaned, ownership is transferred to 
the iFolder Admin user for reassignment to another user or for deletion. You initially 
specify the iFolder Admin user during the iFolder enterprise server configuration 
in YaST. </P>
  <P>The iFolder Admin user must be provisioned in order to enable the iFolder 
    Admin to perform management tasks. iFolder tracks this user by the LDAP object 
    GUID, allowing it to belong to any LDAP container or group in the tree, even 
    those that are not identified as Search DNs. The user&#146;s movement can 
    be tracked anywhere in the tree because it is known by the GUID, not by the 
    user DN.</P>
  <P>The iFolder Admin right can be assigned to other users so that they can also 
    manage iFolder services for the selected server. Only users who are in one 
    of the DNs specified in the LDAP Search DN are eligible to be equivalent to 
    the iFolder Admin user.</P>
  <P>If you assign the iFolder Admin right to other 
users, those users are governed by the roster and Search DN relationship. The 
user is removed from the roster and stripped of the iFolder Admin right if you 
delete the user, remove the user&#146;s DN from the list of Search DNs, or move 
the user to a DN that is not in the Search DNs.</P>
