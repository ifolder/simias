<H4>Understanding iFolder Access Rights </H4>
<p>The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of access for members of an iFolder:</p>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT></B> <FONT SIZE="-1">Members of an LDAPGroup inherit the access rights set for that LDAPGroup.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P><B>Owner<BR>
      </B>Only one user or LDAPGroup serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is 
      typically the user or any member of the LDAPGroup who created the iFolder. 
      If the owner is an LDAPGroup and in that case, all the members of the LDAPGroup 
      will have the ownership on that iFolder. The owner user or members of the 
      owner LDAPGroup can use the iFolder client to transfer ownership to another 
      member of the iFolder. The iFolder Admin user can transfer ownership to 
      any user or LDAPGroup on the iFolder server.</P>
    <P>The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user or LDAPGroup 
      has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights 
      for member users and LDAPGroups, and can remove the Full Control right for 
      any member. With an enterprise server, the disk space used by the owner&#146;s 
      iFolders count against the owner&#146;s user disk quotas on the enterprise 
      server.</P>
    <P>If a user or LDAPGroup is deleted from the iFolder system, the iFolders 
      owned by the user or LDAPGroup are orphaned. Orphaned iFolders are temporarily 
      assigned to the iFolder Admin user as owner. Membership and synchronization 
      continues for other users and LDAPGroup members while the iFolder Admin 
      user determines whether an orphaned iFolder should be deleted or assigned 
      to a new owner.</P>
  <P><B>Full Control</B><BR>
      A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. The 
      user or LDAPGroup with the Full Control right has read/write access to the 
      iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the 
      owner.</P>
  <P><B>Read/Write</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</P>
  <P><B>Read Only</B><BR>
    A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can copy an iFolder file to another location and modify it outside the iFolder.</P>
