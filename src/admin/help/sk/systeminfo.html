<P>The iFolder Admin user is the primary administrator of the iFolder 
enterprise server. Whenever iFolders are orphaned, ownership is transferred to 
the iFolder Admin user for reassignment to another user or for deletion. You initially 
specify the iFolder Admin user during the iFolder enterprise server configuration 
in YaST. </P>
  <P>The iFolder Admin user must be provisioned in order to enable the iFolder 
    Admin to perform management tasks. iFolder tracks this user by the LDAP object 
    GUID, allowing it to belong to any LDAP container or group in the tree, even 
    those that are not identified as Search DNs. The user&#146;s movement can 
    be tracked anywhere in the tree because it is known by the GUID, not by the 
    user DN.</P>
  <P>The iFolder Admin right can be assigned to other users so that they can also 
    manage iFolder services for the selected server. Only users who are in one 
    of the DNs specified in the LDAP Search DN are eligible to be equivalent to 
    the iFolder Admin user.</P>
  <P>If you assign the iFolder Admin right to other 
users, those users are governed by the roster and Search DN relationship. The 
user is removed from the roster and stripped of the iFolder Admin right if you 
delete the user, remove the user&#146;s DN from the list of Search DNs, or move 
the user to a DN that is not in the Search DNs.</P><P><font size="-1"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You cannot assign the Admin user

        <h4>Disk Quota</h4>

      <TD>

          System-wide settings supersede user policies.</p>
		  <P>Deselect the check box to disable a system-wide quota.</P>
        <P>Select the check box to enable a system-wide quota, then specify the 
          total space quota (in MB) for a user's account. </P>
        <P>If you enable a system-wide quota that is less than a user's

          quota is increased to a value that is larger than the user's total 
          space consumed.</P>
        <P>Enabling or modifying the system-wide quota does not affect existing 
          individual user quotas. Any existing user quota always overrides a system-wide 
          quota, whether the user quota is lower or higher than the system-wide 
          quota.</P>

          <P>              Consider the following demands on your system to determine an appropriate file size limit for iFolders in your environment:</P>
            <ul><li><p>Intended use               
            </p></li>

                 <li> <p>How the applications that use the largest files actually save changes to the file (whole file or deltas)</p>
                 </li><li><p>How frequently the files are synchronized by each member</p>
                  </li><li><p>How many users share an iFolder</p>

        <p> Even if you set a very large value as a file size limit and if there 
          is no quota to limit file sizes, the practical limit is governed by 
          the file system on the user's computer. For example, FAT32 volumes have 
          a maximum file size of 4 GB minus 1 byte. </p>
