%description
This package adds Novell's iFolder server. Using the iFolder client,
users can share files across the enterprise with other users. The
iFolder server provides back-up and synchronization across the network
to multiple machines and also enables Web-based access to files on the
server.

  policy getting reset.

  Silent install, Server side migration, Conflict Resolution etc.
- #350687,349198: Slave setup for SSL fixed by explicitly getting the
  certificate from Master instead of auto-redirect. Now a new
  certificate policy is setup for the Global Simias and the Sync handler
  to handle certificate exchange.
- #349081,347919: Member nodes were made not to collide and also made to
  always sync from master, so any change in slave will not sync if there
  is a collision. This is fixed by excluding the search context of master
  in slave.

  communication if the Master is SSL. This is fixed using auto-redirect.

- SSL option is enabled in the setup code. simias-server-setup now
  prompts for SSL option. Entering Yes will configure the server for
  SSL. CLI option is --use-ssl
- #346410: This was due to the group nodes getting a collision while
  syncing to Slave, possibly due to LDAP sync happening before the
  domain sync. Or LDAP sync syncing the same object as of Domain if the
  master and slave have the same search context. Now the collision is
  avoid for member sync from Master to Slave.
