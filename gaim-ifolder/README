---------------------------------
Building the Gaim iFolder Plugin
---------------------------------

First, you must build Gaim.  Follow the instructions available from
http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ for your particular platform and come back to
these instructions.  For anybody using Novell Linux Desktop (NLD), I've
included instructions to do this below in the "Building Gaim on NLD" section
(These instructions for NLD should be about the same for other Linux
distributions).

Copy "ifolder.c" to the "gaim/plugins" directory.  From the "gaim/plugins"
directory type the following to build the plugin:

Linux
------

	make ifolder.so

Win32
------

	make -f Makefile.mingw ifolder.dll

-----------------------------------
Installing the Gaim iFolder Plugin
-----------------------------------

Once you've got a library (.so/.dll), copy the library file to the following
directory:

Linux
------

	<your gaim prefix>/lib/gaim/
	
Win32
------

	C:\Program Files\Gaim\plugins\

Now start Gaim and the iFolder Plugin will be available from the "Preferences"
window under "Plugins".

Installing the Invitation Graphics
-----------------------------------

I haven't figured out the best way to do this yet, so for now, copy the PNG
files inside the gaim-ifolder/pixmaps/ directory (ifolder48.png &
glyphmarks48.png) to you Gaim User directory:

Linux
------

	~/.gaim/

Win32
------

	? - I'm not sure what this would be.  If you know, please fill me in and I
	    will update these instructions.


--------------------------------------
Using/Testing the Gaim iFolder Plugin
--------------------------------------

Once you've installed and enabled the plugin, you'll be able to simulate adding
a member to an iFolder.  Normally, once we plug in the calls to iFolder/Simias,
an invitation to share an iFolder will be sent to a buddy automatically when
you add the buddy as a member of an iFolder.

To simulate adding a buddy as an iFolder member, right-click on the buddy in
the Gaim Buddy List and select "Simulate Add Member".  It will prompt you for
a collection name and collection type (eventually you'll be able to share any
Simias collection types, like Glyphmarks, etc.).  When you press OK, an
invitation to share that collection will be sent to the buddy.  If the buddy
also has the Gaim iFolder Plugin installed, they'll be able to Accept/Reject
the invitation (and you'll see that when they do).

To bring up a list of pending invitations (incoming or outgoing), you can
right-click on a buddy in the buddy list and select "Simias Invitations" or
you can press the "Show Invitations" button on the iFolder plugin preferences
page.

Note: It might be easy to annoy buddies who do not have this plugin installed
by sending them invitations (since they'll see a message asking them to install
the plugin.  Either don't do this, or help them get the plugin installed too so
you can both join in on the fun.

Building Gaim on NLD
---------------------

1. Download Gaim 1.1.2 to your home directory

	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gaim/gaim-1.1.2.tar.bz2?download

2. Uncompress the source package

	cd /home/<your-username>
	tar -xjvf gaim-1.1.2.tar.bz2 (this will create the gaim-1.1.2/ directory
                                  in your home directory)

3. Build and Install Gaim

	cd /home/<your-username>/gaim-1.1.2
	./configure --prefix=/home/<your-username>/gaim-stage --enable-debug
	make install

4. Build and Install the Gaim iFolder Plugin

	Copy gaim-ifolder/ifolder.c into /home/<your-username>/gaim-1.1.2/plugins
	
	cd /home/<your-username>/gaim-1.1.2/plugins
	make ifolder.so
	cp ifolder.so /home/<your-username>/gaim-stage/lib/gaim

	Follow the instructions above to install ifolder48.png & glyphmarks48.png.

5. Run Gaim with a test configuration directory so you won't interfere with
   any Gaim preferences you've already established.
   
   cd /home/<your-username>/gaim-stage
   ./gaim --config=/home/<your-username>/.gaim-stage

6. Enable the Gaim iFolder Plugin in Gaim Preferences | Plugins and you're
   ready to start!
